In this course we will build a REST API using Spark framework. This REST API will be backed by SQL database and implement object relational mapper. We also explore using a package that allows us to take our model objects and turn them into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

The project that we will build is a public facing REST API that will allow people to review online courses. This API will providing a way for people to:
Submit a brand new course
Submit reviews for each course
This API is made to exact courses from everywhere. Thus client of the API can request a list of courses that have reviews as well as submit a new course and new review.

This kind of aggregation of information is a common use case of Software as a Service or SaaS.
