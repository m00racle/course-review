In this course we will build a REST API using Spark framework. This REST API will be backed by SQL database and implement object relational mapper. We also explore using a package that allows us to take our model objects and turn them into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

The project that we will build is a public facing REST API that will allow people to review online courses. This API will providing a way for people to:
Submit a brand new course
Submit reviews for each course
This API is made to exact courses from everywhere. Thus client of the API can request a list of courses that have reviews as well as submit a new course and new review.

This kind of aggregation of information is a common use case of Software as a Service or SaaS.

This is a wrap:
I think API is just part of DAO, Service layer mostly, Well controller and model also exist in this case but minus
the View parts of programming.

More to come in the Spring REST API which I think will be more elaborate.
